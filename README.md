# thanos-custon-calculator

Have you seen Avengers Infinity War?
Remember the scene where Thanos throws part of the moon at the avengers?

This custom calculator calculates just how much force will be produced by that attack. 
You will input how much of the moon he will throw, how fast he initially throws it, and if the Avengers save the day or not. 

Based on your inputs, the amount of force produced will be displayed.
